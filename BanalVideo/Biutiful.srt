1
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:10,615
Is it real?

2
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:12,142
Yes.

3
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:14,976
It's said to be from Dad to Mum.

4
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:17,934
Why have you got it?

5
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:23,301
Your grandfather gave it to your
grandmother before he left Spain.

6
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:27,502
She was pregnant with him...

7
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,735
...and never saw him again.

8
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:31,897
It's lovely.

9
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,979
I never thought I'd touch  a real diamond.

10
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:39,818
- Can I try it on?
- Yes.

11
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:50,786
- It's yours now, darling.
- Really?

12
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:56,466
I don't know.
Mama always wore it on this finger.

13
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:59,786
She said it wasn't real.

14
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:05,417
Your mama never heard that sound.

15
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,627
What is sound?

16
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,065
Sound of the sea.

17
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,260
<i>When I was little...</i>

18
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,219
<i>one radio station played
the sounds of the sea.</i>

19
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:22,667
<i>Giant waves.</i>

20
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:35,632
<i>The sounds scared me.</i>

21
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:38,353
<i>Why were you scared?</i>

22
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:42,591
<i>The bottom of the sea scared me.</i>

23
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:48,872
<i>All the creatures that live there.</i>

24
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,788
Daddy?

25
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,233
Daddy ...

26
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,476
Did you know that when the owl dies...

27
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:03,630
it spits out the hair ball?

28
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,067
Ponytail does not fit in here.
You look ketulta.

29
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,390
That scares the owls away.

30
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,514
I saw that movie too.

31
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:16,590
Don't you believe me?

32
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,147
Before, there was nothing here.

33
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,628
Just water. Salt water.

34
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,355
Do you know what that sounded  like?

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,838
And the wind.

36
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,832
And both together?

37
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,203
What's that over there?

38
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,646
When did the symptoms start?

39
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,531
I don't know...months ago.

40
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:15,123
You can get dressed.

41
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,284
Couldn't you have come sooner?

42
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,369
It didn't hurt like this before.

43
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:35,453
A nurse is coming to take
a blood sample.

44
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,773
Days.

45
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,135
Did not you answer?

46
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,289
Open and close the fist.

47
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,810
- Is that a new syringe?
- Yes.

48
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,370
- Is it?
- Yes, do not be afraid. It's new.

49
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,330
- Damn!
- Sorry.

50
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:27,813
- Are you new?
- Suoniasi is hard to find.

51
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,691
- Be careful.
- Sorry.

52
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:34,257
Open and close the fist.

53
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:37,491
Damn!

54
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:40,656
- Enter the syringe.
- Sorry.

55
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,495
Give me the syringe.

56
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:12,656
How do you learn that?

57
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:20,616
- Had eight hours without eating?
- What do you eat?

58
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,499
- Is it called?
- No.

59
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,707
Not Satan. I am no longer pistetä.

60
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,188
Let's go out.

61
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,749
Thank you.

62
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,843
Are quietly ripsesi,
as sydämesikin.

63
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:09,317
Are quietly ripsesi,
as sydämesikin ...

64
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,368
Why can not you leave?

65
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:06,487
What keeps you here?

66
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:27,251
- Did they tell you about the accident?
- Did you hear something?

67
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,727
I only heard Luis.

68
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:33,137
- The boy farthest away...
- Luis.

69
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:37,931
Luis is OK. I helped him further.

70
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,295
He told me he was sorry and asked
to be forgiven...

71
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,370
...for stealing a watch.

72
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,337
Who do you think you are?

73
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:53,290
You're a disgrace. You know nothing.
You come here and just lie to us.

74
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,176
- My son was no thief.
- Let me explain...

75
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,175
Go! - Luis, tell him to go.
Show a bit of respect for our son.

76
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:33,621
He asked after you.

77
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:36,378
Tell him I'll look in in the morning.

78
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,026
Hi.

79
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:06,863
- Dad, I tried to ring you.
- I'm a bit late, sorry.

80
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,140
Get your bag. Are you right?

81
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,547
Thanks for the help, Lili.
Five o'clock tomorrow, OK?

82
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,941
- Says 'bye to Lili.
-'Bye!

83
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:31,060
Fish is yucky. We all eat the same.

84
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,587
What do you want then?

85
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:40,022
A hamburger and chips...

86
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,547
...and a chocolate milkshake.

87
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:45,512
Perfect.

88
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,745
And the lady?

89
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:51,190
Fried egg with sausage...

90
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,108
...and a potato omelette with cream and cinnamon.

91
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:07,106
A hamburger.

92
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:12,155
And look at all the chips.

93
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:15,992
Chips here and chips there.

94
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,991
And a big chocolate milkshake.

95
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:24,514
What will the young lady have?

96
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:27,238
- Fried eggs.
- Fried eggs...

97
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:31,194
- With sausage.
- Sausage...

98
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,669
And a potato omelette.

99
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,916
- Potato omelette...
- with cream and cinnamon.

100
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,989
Everything as requested.

101
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,354
- What did you get for lunch?
- Rice with chicken.

102
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,160
Daddy, did you know...

103
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:57,712
... that if a spacesuit got a hole in it,
it'd explode?

104
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,558
Tomorow I'll ask Lili to give you
something else.

105
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:04,920
- It isn't Lili who does the food.
- So I'll tell Jung.

106
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,917
It's because of the gravity.

107
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,404
Stop kicking the table, Mateo.

108
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:23,602
Don't shove so much food into your mouth.

109
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:27,075
I've told you a thousand times.
A thousand times.

110
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:33,564
Don't be disgusting.
Put it back in your mouth.

111
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,438
Food in your mouth, Mateo. Once more!

112
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,438
Now!

113
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,679
- Do you want any more milk?
- No.

114
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,558
Stop.

115
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,642
Leave the table and go to your room.

116
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,330
Your supposed to go to your room,
not wash your plate.

117
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,328
What is it?

118
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:10,134
I've peed in my pants.

119
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:14,096
I'll wash them in the morning, Daddy.

120
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,387
Yes?

121
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,343
Wait a sec.

122
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,984
Can you turn that down?

123
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,220
Turn down the music and stop singing.

124
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,710
Yes, I'm here. Sorry about that.

125
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,782
Yes, the cemetery rang again.

126
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,501
No, they're building a gallery.

127
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,787
Right over Dad.

128
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:04,351
They've offered good money.

129
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:07,312
They're offering good money.

130
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,750
They fix up about the coffin and so forth.

131
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:17,062
It's a good offer.

132
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,783
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

133
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:27,470
We should have him cremated.

134
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,509
OK, we'll do it then.

135
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:33,985
Yes, OK, I'll call you.

136
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,833
OK, next week.

137
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,554
Look after yourself.

138
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:40,024
Talk to you later.

139
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,827
- Who's being cremated?
- Nobody.

140
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,829
Don't lie.

141
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:54,666
I'll give you a Thai massage.

142
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,709
Who?

143
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,913
- If you don't tell me...
- It's my dad!

144
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,787
We're cremating him.

145
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,437
- Which of you is most like your dad?
- I don't know.

146
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,989
I don't remember how he looked.

147
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,836
Give me a kiss.

148
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,953
I'm going.

149
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:31,721
I gotta go.

150
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,874
Stop it. What the fuck are you doing?

151
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,282
Fucking pig!

152
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:00,520
She's sick in the head.

153
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,602
Where are the others?
I met Chinaza on the way here.

154
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,365
- Where?
- In El Fondo.

155
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,250
I sent that bugger back.

156
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,561
Where Ccheikh and Mamadou?

157
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,880
You gotta keep a check on them,
otherwise we're stuffed.

158
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:54,489
I've said before.. they can't sell here.
It's off limits.

159
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:58,203
Understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

160
00:21:58,373 --> 00:22:01,171
No one buys bugger all down there.

161
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:04,649
I also heard you've started dealing.

162
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:13,448
Boys, pack up, they're coming.

163
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:17,164
Mind the cops. It's time to blow.

164
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:21,334
I got something to show you.
Home at my place.

165
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:24,010
Your place? Heavens...

166
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:35,254
It's stuck.

167
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,294
Can't open it.

168
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,656
Thanks, lge.

169
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,731
No sense in dropping the price
if nobody wants them.

170
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,293
Are they all the same?

171
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,129
Most of them.

172
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,374
This month's been a disaster.
You gotta talk to the Chinese.

173
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,659
Maybe I can get some umbrellas.

174
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,734
Fuck that.
There's fuck-all rain around here.

175
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:06,489
Yeah, you're right there.

176
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:13,378
- Can you get the kid to sleep?
- You'd think there was no one here.

177
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,578
A bit of quiet. I've got guests.

178
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:23,535
Who's done this? Is it you?

179
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:27,418
Who did this shit?
Is this your handbag?

180
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:42,220
We're getting nowhere with pirate stuff
for cash. It's now or never.

181
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,339
20 building workers at 1300 euro each...

182
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,940
That's a lot of money.

183
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:52,655
- I gotta think about that.
- We're stuffed with all your ideas.

184
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:54,623
We're losing the contract with Mendoza.

185
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:58,700
The workers then?
Will they go on making this shit?

186
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:03,146
I don't know what you're talking about
but we gotta do something, and quickly.

187
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:07,184
I don't think I'll go on selling shit.

188
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:13,060
- The idiot must be good at something.
- The idiot's done a lot more.

189
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:27,666
That's for your friend in the police.

190
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,547
Did you talk to Mendoza?

191
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:34,147
Yes. My brother has a contact
in a building site in Badalona.

192
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:37,190
They need a lot of workers right now.
How much money in it?

193
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,223
How much?

194
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,904
That's nothing to laugh about, hai.
How much is it?

195
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:51,505
What's up with you?
It's sensitive and I have family.

196
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,828
We aren't home in China.

197
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,986
I know.

198
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,030
Why did you come?

199
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:07,988
Because I love you.

200
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:20,633
You are a strong man.

201
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,588
An important man.

202
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:26,593
Do you love me?

203
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,310
Say that you love.
I know that you love.

204
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:01,031
Did not you already get it?
I speak like Chinese?

205
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:05,081
- I've said.
- I can sell here, Uxbal.

206
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:07,916
Otherwise you better fucking-well
learn African.

207
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:15,115
You better talk to your people too
and get them to calm down.

208
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:18,433
That's what I pay you for.

209
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:24,803
Listen, Uxbal. We've known each other
quite a while now.

210
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:28,435
But next time you stuff up,
you're finished.

211
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:30,039
Got it?

212
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:33,641
Understood?

213
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,683
OK, let them know.

214
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,796
For October and November.

215
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:51,283
Next time they pay late, I put them inside.

216
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:54,884
Got it? Or shall I translate?

217
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:54,007
- Daddy's home.
- Mummy picked us up barefoot.

218
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,735
I took my shoes off, too.

219
00:27:56,895 --> 00:27:59,455
-Well? -Well what?

220
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,052
- Why weren't you home?
- I can't be two places at once.

221
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,651
Mummy's making spaghetti.

222
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:08,851
Turn off the TV.

223
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:11,087
Sit down and eat.

224
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:13,894
Why is the shower on?

225
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,895
You don't have one ironed shirt.
Good way to iron, eh?

226
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:40,014
Come and eat.

227
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,057
Lili rang, she was upset.

228
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,020
We agreed you should tell me
if you fetched the children.

229
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,174
Sorry... a customer cancelled.

230
00:28:48,342 --> 00:28:51,015
So call me on my mobile.

231
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,537
Will you have some omelette?
It's with apple slices.

232
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:05,697
Just like the potato one,
but softer and sweet.

233
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:11,023
- Aren't you eating?
- No, I'm not hungry.

234
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:15,136
Miguel's daughter said they were out
in the car yesterday...

235
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:17,978
...when a motorbike overtook them going
like a goddamned maniac.

236
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:20,740
So Miguel yelled out: "Hope you die!"

237
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:23,420
Five minutes later they saw
the motorbike lying on the road...

238
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,544
..and the rider was a pulp in a pool of blood.

239
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:30,017
Miguel was so shocked that
he drove to the hospital.

240
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,497
I don't understand why.
If someone did that to me...

241
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:36,466
Quiet. Marambra, that's enough.

242
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:42,541
If you could stop talking,
maybe you'd get hungry.

243
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,420
Do me a favour...put that cigarette out.

244
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,422
And take your foot off the table
when we're eating.

245
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,658
Do you want to stay and watch
a movie after, Mummy?

246
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:05,390
It's late, sweetie.

247
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:11,463
If I can't talk, how do I get you
not to include them at funerals?

248
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:14,100
That's why Mateo's still wetting his bed.

249
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,500
I haven't had them for ages.

250
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:18,745
That's not what they say.
Just because you have custody...

251
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:23,111
Do you come to hit your kids
or question them?

252
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:29,309
Mamma, the spaghetti tastes nothing.

253
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:34,185
- You've still nearly eaten it all up.
- Off you go.

254
00:30:35,115 --> 00:30:38,551
Go on. Let's at least eat in peace.

255
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:42,425
Best I leave.

256
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,027
See you darling.
Enjoy yourself sweetie.

257
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,397
Marambra...

258
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,794
Sorry. You did good.

259
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,519
Did good? Yeah.

260
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:37,755
Fuck what you think of me.
I'm not a dog.

261
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:42,121
You've turned the kids against me,
no Marambra, you did that yourself.

262
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:45,081
It's like it pisses you off to see me happy.

263
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:48,121
Only with you is it hard to be myself
and feel good..

264
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,958
Do you remember where you lived
last time you felt good?

265
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,921
Do you want me to remind you?

266
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,278
You don't need to remind me.

267
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,681
Why are you laughing?

268
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:11,279
I laugh at anything.
And I like to see people smile.

269
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:15,439
I'm happy if I'm happy
and down if I'm down.

270
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,722
I just wanted......

271
00:32:23,728 --> 00:32:25,559
I love you.

272
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,524
I said I loved you.

273
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,644
Yes, me too.

274
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,333
You wouldn't have some money on you?

275
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:23,209
Haven't you got any more? No.

276
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:27,731
Now that you're selling the grave.
Who told you that?

277
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,968
Tito. When did you talk to him?

278
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:42,047
Please don't start. I gave him a massage.
He had a backache.

279
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:50,938
It's not a grave, it's a niche.

280
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:23,214
But...

281
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:28,736
No one told me I was obliged to fast.

282
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,095
And...

283
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,493
...it might be a technical error.

284
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:39,101
No, I'll complain.
Fasting is just a formality.

285
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:42,342
How's it coming along? Excuse me?

286
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:45,216
How...

287
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:48,378
I've gotta know what happened.

288
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,617
It depends on how your body
reacts to chemotherapy.

289
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:54,778
In your case it's gone a long time-

290
00:34:54,946 --> 00:35:00,418
and it has metatasted from the prostate
to the skeleton and liver.

291
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:02,980
Which means...

292
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:07,624
But how long? Roughly how long?

293
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:15,057
With medical treatment you can keep
your lifestyle...

294
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:17,185
...for a couple of months.

295
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:23,740
Months?

296
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:25,673
Daddy, I've learnt to do a trick.

297
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:28,351
Think of a country that starts with D.

298
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,508
Daddy, look at me.

299
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,469
Ready? Yes.

300
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:34,794
Then think of an animal that starts with L.

301
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:38,632
Hippopotamus doesn't start with L.

302
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,116
You thought of leeches in Denmark.

303
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,754
How did you know that?

304
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:55,434
Daddy, how do you spell "beautiful"?

305
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:58,035
-Like it sounds. -With an i?

306
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:03,518
Biutiful.

307
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:37,465
No, that's OK, don't be scared.

308
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:42,297
Just fetch the kids and take them home.

309
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:45,057
I don't know.

310
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:49,705
Til i get out. In a couple of days, probably.

311
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,665
It's getting tough.

312
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:15,581
We close down the handbags and copy movies.

313
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:18,787
You were right.

314
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:22,982
The building side is lucrative.

315
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:26,748
The building workers can keep going
at Mendoza's.

316
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:31,065
Pay the ones we agreed on.

317
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:36,506
You won't regret it We're helping them.

318
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:41,429
And it's safer for us.
There's a lot of money to be made.

319
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:45,552
Uxbal asked me for money for the stoves
in the warehouse.

320
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:50,266
I don't want anyone to freeze in the cellar.

321
00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:54,429
OK, I'll see what I can do.
Where are you going?

322
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,308
I've got to go home.

323
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,995
Are you going to fight about a nigger?

324
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,918
How much was the bail?

325
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:37,039
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

326
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:42,560
Forget it. I'll take it from the money
they give us for Dad's niche.

327
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,752
Has it been fixed up?

328
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:50,280
We just gotta fill in some forms from
the cemetery and we get the money.

329
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:53,839
But first we gotta cremate him.
After that we can do what we want.

330
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,802
We can bury him with Mum's ashes
and save money.

331
00:42:56,964 --> 00:43:00,161
Look at these things.

332
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:03,523
Careful, they're Dad's papers.

333
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:10,720
How's it going with the Chinese
on the building site?

334
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:15,518
Mendoza is totally crapped off.

335
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,842
Most of them know nothing about building.

336
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:21,841
None of them speak Spanish
and they all look the same.

337
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:25,237
Have you told Marambra about the cemetery?

338
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:26,806
No.

339
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:35,044
She rang me a while ago. She rang me
looking for you, or something.

340
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:39,326
But I didn't say anything to her.
I haven't seen her for ages.

341
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:22,125
Uxbal?

342
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:28,486
Take this.

343
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:33,562
That's not necessary.
I gotta know what my son said.

344
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:39,088
The day before the accident we had a row.

345
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,696
That was the last I...

346
00:44:43,656 --> 00:44:48,776
Your son went off peacefully.
He was scared, so I helped him.

347
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:52,812
He talked about your watch
and where he'd hidden it.

348
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:54,972
Where?

349
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,256
Behind a leg of his bed.

350
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:01,978
Yes.

351
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:12,498
I'm very sorry. Really.

352
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:39,298
Who is it? It's me.

353
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,377
I expected you tomorrow I was in the area and...

354
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:49,183
Come in.

355
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:52,896
Thanks for the help with the kids
I was thinking I could take them now...

356
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:54,743
Quiet.

357
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:58,782
The kids are asleep. What did you tell them?

358
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:02,655
That you were at your brother's.
Something about your work..

359
00:46:07,747 --> 00:46:12,298
I'll pick them up in the morning
before they go to school, OK?

360
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:14,344
You're welcome to stay.

361
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:17,068
I can put on coffee or tea.

362
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:19,457
There's wine, too.

363
00:46:19,828 --> 00:46:24,424
Don't look at me like that.
I haven't started drinking.

364
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:29,388
I opened it for a friend.
Remember my friend Laura?

365
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,315
Cheers.

366
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:41,470
Tack.

367
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,510
Did they hurt you? No, I'm OK.

368
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:57,389
Ana told me about something she dreamt.

369
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,156
You had come home to the flat
and the bedroom was full of sand.

370
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:07,075
As the dune, which stretched
up to the ceiling.

371
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,916
- You dig up the initiative ...
- I'm leaving.

372
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:14,915
I asked her where Mateo was.

373
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:18,433
She said she didn't know.

374
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,878
But she believed he was buried
under the sand.

375
00:48:23,363 --> 00:48:25,923
Why are you going?

376
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,633
Stay.

377
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:40,915
I think you'll see me differently.

378
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,558
I don't think it's a good idea.

379
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:48,243
We both know what will happen.
There's room for everyone here.

380
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,158
From the kitchen you get
a glimpse of the sea.

381
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:54,035
We can have breakfast together
like we used to.

382
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:56,357
I can make toast for you...

383
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:01,038
- Be quiet a moment.
- The children need me.

384
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:04,199
The can't wake up to a new father
every weekend.

385
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,278
You always come out with that crap.

386
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:09,599
It's not just about the kids. I need you.

387
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:13,044
I haven't had a relapse in five months.

388
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:15,882
Give me a chance, darling.

389
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,727
You've said that a hundred times.

390
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,082
I haven't had a turn for ages.
It's different now, I promise.

391
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,882
Are you taking those tablets?

392
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:28,849
You got me to stop taking them
so I could breastfeed Mateo.

393
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,730
You're obsessed with those damned pills.

394
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:34,451
The doctor said you had to...

395
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:38,241
The doctor says anything to get rid of me.

396
00:49:38,413 --> 00:49:42,452
None of that shit is going
to cure my depression.

397
00:49:44,412 --> 00:49:47,484
I'm trying with a lightbox now.
With a what?

398
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:51,042
A lightbox. It's terrific.

399
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:55,729
And much cheaper than medicine.
Can I show you?

400
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:12,413
You see?

401
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,371
It really is terrific.

402
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:21,934
I started a couple of months ago.

403
00:50:22,178 --> 00:50:25,887
I feel better than ever.
But not like before.

404
00:50:26,058 --> 00:50:29,334
It's different now.
I feel normal.

405
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:31,728
Like everyone else.

406
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:23,215
No, stop it Marambra.

407
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:28,739
No, cut it out...

408
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:31,056
Stop.

409
00:51:36,506 --> 00:51:38,542
It's OK.

410
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,742
You're really tired.

411
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:47,063
- Besides, I'm getting old.
- No...no...what are you talking about?

412
00:51:48,468 --> 00:51:51,346
That's me. At the police station...

413
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:56,306
...couldn't I stop thinking...

414
00:51:57,308 --> 00:52:01,062
...about coming back to you and the kids again.

415
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,747
The kids and I need...

416
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,306
Do you remember the time we fucked
in the little cloakroom?

417
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:22,900
I'd just come to Barcelona and
you greeted me at the drycleaners

418
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:26,189
You took me in the cloakroom.

419
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:29,830
The owner caught us...

420
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:18,388
Up you get!

421
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:24,391
It's six-thirty.
There's bread and tea out there.

422
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:26,427
Get moving!

423
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,872
I'm always getting into all kinds of crap.

424
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:06,480
There are four underage minors.
I don't pay in advance.

425
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:09,636
If we get inspected, where will
I hide so many damned Chinese?

426
00:54:09,805 --> 00:54:11,158
It's our only condition, Mendoza.

427
00:54:11,325 --> 00:54:15,079
I don't pay a cent til I know
I've got something

428
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:17,884
That's how we always do it.
Right, Uxbal?

429
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:18,921
A week on trial.

430
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:21,838
Half of them are sick and frozen.

431
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:24,678
They've never even seen a drill.

432
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:27,883
It doesn't help cut costs.

433
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,845
The costs?

434
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:32,244
OK.

435
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:38,518
Then you can go and hire
unionised construction workers.

436
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:41,998
When you've worked it out, ring me.

437
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,841
- When do you need the money?
- A week from today.

438
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,605
Stop looking like a scared Chinaman..
I'll pay for next week.

439
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:03,365
But then I'll have the papers
latest on Friday.

440
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:05,169
Ok, OK.

441
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,050
That's it.

442
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:11,244
How long are we here?

443
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:14,888
I do not know.
A couple of days.

444
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,726
Can I invite Lili?

445
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:22,090
This press.
I can not carry this.

446
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:28,287
Horrible smell.

447
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:35,164
I throw the fish away?
It has been thawed 3O times.

448
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:39,891
Do not touch the fridge barefoot.
Especially when the floor is wet.

449
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:42,929
Electricity travels at random.

450
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:44,768
Stairs are heavy.

451
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:47,575
Neighbor Emma thinner comfortable levels.

452
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:51,486
I know that the stomach was cut.

453
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:57,856
The doctor put a new pin hole in it.

454
00:55:58,257 --> 00:55:59,576
My God!

455
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:02,810
Too bad the electricity went.
I bought ice cream.

456
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:07,370
Is familiar with the mango?
Needless to chocolate.

457
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,688
Ana, get spoons.

458
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:12,408
I just bought you piparijätskiä.

459
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:17,889
Melted.
- It's better that way.

460
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,891
Nami.

461
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,939
Here.

462
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,690
Chocolate?

463
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,177
Do not pig telecommunications, son.

464
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:41,293
On Anas birthday... could the four of us
go to the country?

465
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:44,057
Only at the weekend.

466
00:56:44,263 --> 00:56:46,652
- Sure. Where to?
- Dunno.

467
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:49,292
The Pyrenees. The kids have never seen snow.

468
00:56:49,464 --> 00:56:51,534
They've never been out of this part of town.

469
00:56:51,704 --> 00:56:54,093
We can camp.

470
00:56:54,264 --> 00:56:57,939
No, I'd rather have a dog, a little dog

471
00:56:58,105 --> 00:57:01,654
No, darling.
They poo all day and cost a fortune.

472
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:04,624
Travelling's much more fun.
Give me a bit.

473
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:07,175
I gotta taste it.

474
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:11,624
- What are you doing, Marambra?
- Do you want to taste it?

475
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:15,421
Use your spoon. Don't do that...
You're disgusting.

476
00:57:15,587 --> 00:57:18,545
-Good, eh? -Wanna try?

477
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:20,578
Do it.

478
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:22,305
Stick your hand in.

479
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:23,981
Once more.

480
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:28,580
-Isn't that great? -Stop it.

481
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:36,501
What are you grumbling about? Or don't you
remember when you proposed to me?

482
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,103
What'd he do?

483
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:42,342
If you're gonna tell the story tell
about the look you gave me.

484
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,422
You and your look. I hadn't seen you yet.

485
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:49,948
- Hadn't you ever seen me?
- I'm telling this, not you.

486
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,381
The day I met your dad at a party he said...

487
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:57,830
...that I had the most beautiful nose
he had ever seen.

488
00:57:57,991 --> 00:58:00,585
And obviously I believed him.

489
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:04,665
Then he took my hand to read my future.

490
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:08,382
He said that I'd get married
to a completely hopeless man...

491
00:58:08,554 --> 00:58:10,829
...but that I'd be truly loved.

492
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:14,702
Who knows how many birds he'd used that on,
but it worked with me.

493
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:18,628
He said that if I let go of his hand
it wouldn't come true.

494
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:21,592
And straightaway, before I knew
what was happening...

495
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:25,667
...he pulled my hand towards his nose...

496
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,908
...and shoved my finger up his nostril.

497
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:32,384
He dug out a booger and lay it in my hand...

498
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:36,072
...and said that I'd always have
part of him with me.

499
00:58:36,237 --> 00:58:39,946
A black hairy piece of snot.
It was disgusting.

500
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:41,994
So what are you whining about?

501
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:45,513
It's not true. Would you believe
I'd do something like that?

502
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:34,440
Whadda you want?

503
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,037
Have you come to beg forgiveness?

504
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:44,314
Money? Don't give me any frigging money.

505
00:59:44,484 --> 00:59:46,679
Say sorry to them too.

506
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:50,963
Just seeing you...
if you hadn't had kids I'd have killed you.

507
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:53,082
They knew what they were doing.

508
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:56,443
They were illegals and they pushed drugs.

509
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:59,803
Ekweme and the others knew
they couldn't be here.

510
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,117
The police won't allow it.

511
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:04,278
Understand?

512
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:07,197
Take the fucking money.

513
01:00:10,008 --> 01:00:13,637
Me? What'll I do with my kid?

514
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:17,159
Dunno. Dunno.

515
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:42,496
Here, drink this.

516
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,098
How are things with your wife?

517
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:54,497
OK. Better.

518
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:57,939
- And the children?
- The kids are fine.

519
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,624
And you?

520
01:03:00,788 --> 01:03:02,938
You're dying.

521
01:03:04,149 --> 01:03:06,105
Looks like it.

522
01:03:06,469 --> 01:03:08,380
Spit.

523
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:23,147
How's life looking?

524
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:25,700
Are you prepared to leave it?

525
01:03:26,872 --> 01:03:30,148
Yes, I think so. I'm working on it.

526
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:32,780
You think so? You've got to be sure.

527
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:36,191
Get your life in order.
Leave nothing undone.

528
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:38,423
I don't want to die, Bea.

529
01:03:40,513 --> 01:03:43,869
I'm afraid to leave the kids in the lurch.

530
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:47,264
Do you believe that it's you
who looks after the children?

531
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:50,232
Don't be naive, Uxbal.
The Universe looks after them.

532
01:03:50,395 --> 01:03:53,592
Yes, but the universe doesn't pay the rent.

533
01:03:57,075 --> 01:03:59,635
When I was Ana's age...

534
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:03,072
...my mum died. I scarcely remember her.

535
01:04:03,235 --> 01:04:06,466
My dad died without me ever meeting him.

536
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:10,512
That won't happen with my kids.

537
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:13,986
Tell them. Tell them everything.

538
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:17,946
We know the dead'll never be in peace
if they're in debt to the living.

539
01:04:18,118 --> 01:04:21,827
Why is this happening to me?
Is it punishment?

540
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:24,834
You can give up and let go...

541
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:28,469
...or hang on like stupid people do.

542
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,755
It's a long, strenuous journey, Uxbal.

543
01:04:30,919 --> 01:04:33,991
Death is not the end, you know that.

544
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,195
I won't die, Bea.

545
01:04:37,721 --> 01:04:39,120
No.

546
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,594
No.

547
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:51,398
Yes, you will die.

548
01:04:53,282 --> 01:04:56,479
I see it and there's nothing I can do.

549
01:04:57,323 --> 01:05:01,601
Put your life in order, Uxbal.
That's all that matters.

550
01:05:03,163 --> 01:05:05,802
Chemo's poison.

551
01:05:17,845 --> 01:05:20,234
What did you have for breakfast?

552
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:22,396
Milk coffee.

553
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:29,685
You've always been a handsome boy.

554
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:33,478
Remember what I said the day we met?

555
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:37,082
That we got our free gift...

556
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:39,806
...so we'll pass it on.

557
01:05:46,448 --> 01:05:47,722
Here.

558
01:05:47,888 --> 01:05:50,277
When it's necessary,
give them to the children.

559
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:52,804
-What is it?
-For protection.

560
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,763
When you leave them...

561
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,490
...give them one each.

562
01:06:21,332 --> 01:06:24,290
He said it felt like a sea of mud inside him.

563
01:06:25,413 --> 01:06:28,211
And his eyes felt like jelly...

564
01:06:28,373 --> 01:06:30,841
...and his hair burnt.

565
01:07:15,978 --> 01:07:20,017
Everybody up. It's 6.30.

566
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:38,258
- How many stoves did Uxbal bring?
- Six.

567
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,819
How's Ana?

568
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:52,774
Hi, Lili.

569
01:07:52,984 --> 01:07:54,815
How're things?

570
01:07:55,824 --> 01:07:59,533
I hope the stoves'll stop you from freezing.

571
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,894
Ana feels fine. She wants to meet you.

572
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:05,340
We've moved in with her mother ....
she misses you.

573
01:08:05,505 --> 01:08:08,417
I miss her too.
She loves to play with Li.

574
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:14,099
Uxbal, Hai wants to talk to you.

575
01:08:16,866 --> 01:08:20,415
- See you, Lili.
- 'Bye. Say goodbye.

576
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:23,626
Not one more day.

577
01:08:23,787 --> 01:08:27,223
If you want to have them sew 16 hours a day
and exploit them as

578
01:08:27,388 --> 01:08:29,743
- Exploit them?
- Yes, exploit them.

579
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:32,546
D'you know how much they earn in China?

580
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,744
Half a dollar a day.

581
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:38,583
Millions of Chinese'd suck my cock
every morning to be here

582
01:08:38,749 --> 01:08:41,547
You forget I negotiated a salary
for each worker.

583
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:46,305
And I can see down there they're
obviously getting fuck-all.

584
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:48,300
But I don't give a stuff about that.

585
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:51,702
Just give me my share, like we agreed.

586
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,349
Agreed to what?

587
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:55,942
Agreed to what?

588
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,829
You fucking piece of rotten meat!

589
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:00,464
It's my money, you cunt!

590
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:02,383
It's mine!

591
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:06,064
It's my money for fuck's sake! Mine!

592
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:19,221
Fucking blood-sucker. If you don't starve
to death it's due to me.

593
01:09:19,394 --> 01:09:21,430
If the Chinese have work it's thanks to me.

594
01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:24,153
If you two aren't locked up it's thanks to me.

595
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:27,829
If you don't give me half of
Mendozas money, I swear I'll...

596
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:31,192
What'll you do? Who d'you think you are?

597
01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:34,389
You turn everything to your own advantage

598
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:36,069
Uxbal...

599
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,273
They're putting me out in the morning.
You gotta stay at Samuel's.

600
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:24,194
- We're not staying without you.
- Samuel's a Spaniard...

601
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:29,435
Samuel's Senegalese like me.
We go back with you.

602
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:33,436
We'll be together again.
We're still young.

603
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:35,753
Stay.

604
01:10:35,923 --> 01:10:37,641
Stay here at his place and go on studying.

605
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:41,796
Work at the chicken factory again.
I send money to you.

606
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:46,321
Even if I chop off a million chicken heads...

607
01:10:46,484 --> 01:10:49,476
...we can never afford a house here.

608
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,603
We don't belong here.

609
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:55,359
Why would you go back to Senegal?
There's no work at all.

610
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:09,044
A man from the police came.

611
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:14,520
He said we're all being evicted. Everyone.
They gave us til Monday.

612
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,526
Uxbal 'll fix it.

613
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:19,725
I trust him.

614
01:11:19,888 --> 01:11:23,244
I've already spoken to him.

615
01:11:24,809 --> 01:11:27,039
Let him help us.

616
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:50,240
Hi.

617
01:11:51,692 --> 01:11:55,002
Why're you looking like that?
What's happened to you?

618
01:11:55,173 --> 01:11:59,291
Why'd you do it?
You needn't 've gone overboard.

619
01:12:00,613 --> 01:12:04,765
Is that why you asked me to come?
To scold me?

620
01:12:06,814 --> 01:12:10,807
What could've I done?
They do what the fuck they want.

621
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,652
What were you thinking?

622
01:12:12,815 --> 01:12:15,727
Were you the only one who didn't know
they were drug pushers?

623
01:12:15,895 --> 01:12:20,286
I warned you Uxbal. We had to stop the niggers.

624
01:12:20,456 --> 01:12:24,608
The money is not enough for everyone.
Should I live on my miserable salary?

625
01:12:25,255 --> 01:12:27,211
Or will you steal from me?

626
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:30,653
They're being pushed out.
There are women with little kids...

627
01:12:30,816 --> 01:12:33,967
- You aren't Mother Teresa.
- You know what I mean.

628
01:12:34,136 --> 01:12:37,287
It's you who exploit them
so don't give us that shit.

629
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:41,336
I don't exploit them.
I help them get a job.

630
01:12:41,498 --> 01:12:43,966
For money, like all the others.

631
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:49,177
Do you remember Victor, Julia's son?

632
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:53,854
He moved to Murcia to train tigers
in a circus. He gave them food.

633
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,250
They danced for him and licked his face.

634
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,809
I saw the show with my daughter.

635
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,019
She wanted to bring a tiger home.
They seemed to love him.

636
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:06,496
The other month I met his mum.

637
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:10,131
A tiger had torn off a piece
of his face and killed him.

638
01:13:11,302 --> 01:13:15,295
He gave them food every day.
Every day for six years.

639
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:17,737
But he made a mistake.

640
01:13:19,023 --> 01:13:22,299
It's dangerous to trust a starving man.

641
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:24,658
'Specially if his kids are starving too.

642
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:28,133
- What's that got to do with anything?
- What the fuck are you on about?

643
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:32,296
You gotta help Ekweme. He's being kicked out.
You gotta help me.

644
01:13:32,503 --> 01:13:36,894
I'm not an MP. I can't help you.

645
01:13:37,065 --> 01:13:40,740
I can't go on playing I'm the UN.

646
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:44,374
I've got a daughter to look after.
Do you understand?

647
01:13:51,986 --> 01:13:54,295
Be careful, Uxbal.

648
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:58,739
Or take an Alka Seltzer.
Chinese food can be very strong.

649
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:00,386
There are so many of those yellow bastards...

650
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:04,586
...that in the end they'll have the best ham
and we'll get to eat rice.

651
01:14:35,191 --> 01:14:36,909
Daddy, did you know...

652
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,587
... that when owls die they cough up a fur-ball?

653
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:44,506
No, I didn't know that.
Not so loud, you'll wake up Mummy.

654
01:14:44,993 --> 01:14:47,826
Daddy, is mummy mad at us?

655
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,665
No.

656
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,391
Who's that?

657
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:55,909
-Your grandfather. -Let me see.

658
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,191
That was the last photo taken of him
before he went off.

659
01:14:59,355 --> 01:15:01,915
My mum always kept it in her purse.

660
01:15:03,034 --> 01:15:05,343
Where'd he go to?

661
01:15:05,516 --> 01:15:07,188
To Mexico.

662
01:15:07,355 --> 01:15:10,552
- He didn't just go, he fled.
- Why'd he flee?

663
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:14,026
'cause your grandfather couldn't keep
his mouth shut.

664
01:15:14,236 --> 01:15:18,787
At that time Franco persecuted and executed
people who couldn't keep their mouth shut.

665
01:15:20,877 --> 01:15:25,667
When he was 20 he fled from Spain
so as not to die...

666
01:15:25,838 --> 01:15:29,353
...but he died anyway 2 weeks later
in Mexico from a lung inflammation.

667
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:32,236
Do you love him a lot?

668
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,198
I don't know. I never met him.

669
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:41,592
Not having a dad sucks.

670
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,993
When are we going up to see the snow?
Mummy said we're taking the train.

671
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:50,356
-Bags a window-seat. -OK.

672
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,953
If we're going up to the snow...

673
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:55,233
...you gotta build up your strength
'cause there are tons of things to do.

674
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:57,720
Sleeping time.

675
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,872
Careful, It's heavy.

676
01:16:27,046 --> 01:16:30,482
Fuck it, it's sealed with zinc.

677
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:33,314
Pass me the hammer and chisel.

678
01:16:40,127 --> 01:16:42,482
Fuck, he's embalmed.

679
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,240
We take it as it is.

680
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:47,558
...placed the remains of Mateo Gama Fernandez...

681
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:51,561
...in department 27 Saint Joseph year 1966.

682
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:53,958
Wonderful. Everything in order.

683
01:16:54,128 --> 01:16:55,959
Your father died in Mexico.

684
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:59,518
Therefore he was embalmed before
being sent back here by sea.

685
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:02,283
I'm telling you this because
the formaldehyde really works...

686
01:17:02,449 --> 01:17:04,644
...and cremation can take a long time.

687
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,200
The body's driven to Montjuic crematorium.

688
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:11,566
I suppose you'll want an urn.

689
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:17,406
These are his belongings.
They were in the coffin.

690
01:17:19,571 --> 01:17:21,641
Can we see the body?

691
01:17:22,612 --> 01:17:26,605
If you want, but people tend not to....

692
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:31,121
But if you wish I'll call Montjuic right away.

693
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:40,483
Tony, please open the bag for identification.

694
01:19:36,628 --> 01:19:39,381
Sorry, the door was open.

695
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:41,062
I'm coming now.

696
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:52,144
Sometimes the fridge hums...

697
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,949
...but if you give it a bang it'll stop.

698
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:58,182
There's hot water...

699
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:02,025
...but it's best to shower after 10 o'clock. OK??

700
01:20:02,951 --> 01:20:05,067
I think that's everything.

701
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:07,426
Kids' room.

702
01:20:09,112 --> 01:20:11,342
If you like you can be in here.

703
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:14,152
The rent is paid for the next few months.

704
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,866
Fuck...

705
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:38,393
Are you...

706
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,866
Are you OK?

707
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,351
I didn't know you did massage customers
in the middle of the night.

708
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,988
You scared me.

709
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,515
You should see the sky.

710
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:30,354
It's full of stars.

711
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:34,469
It's a damned nuisance that ants
always come in here.

712
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:39,112
Ana said you caught them by smoking
and the mattress caught on fire.

713
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:42,792
- Where have you been?
- Can't I have a bit of fun?

714
01:21:43,002 --> 01:21:45,721
Not with 2 children alone at home...

715
01:21:45,883 --> 01:21:48,158
...who don't know where you are.
And dressed like that.

716
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:52,112
So it's my fault? Now I gotta ask
your permission to be Mummy.

717
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,758
That's what happens when
a seven year old smokes.

718
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:57,358
Things start to burn.
Or didn't you know Mateo smoked?

719
01:21:57,525 --> 01:22:01,359
You can't leave them, nor can you throw
a burning mattress out the window...

720
01:22:01,565 --> 01:22:05,319
...and make them carry it up.
He's only seven.

721
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:09,161
But he can already hurt others like he was 40.

722
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:13,361
He wanted to open the fridge ...

723
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,996
...with wet feet.

724
01:22:21,127 --> 01:22:23,118
And he called me a whore.

725
01:22:26,527 --> 01:22:29,519
The more love I give him...

726
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:32,805
...the more he calls me nasty names.

727
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:38,239
He said it was my fault that we separated.

728
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:41,041
Did you hit him?

729
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:43,167
No.

730
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:51,209
Yes you did.

731
01:22:59,092 --> 01:23:02,368
It's the only way he'll learn.

732
01:23:15,855 --> 01:23:18,050
I bought the train tickets.

733
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,883
Four seats in first class.

734
01:23:23,335 --> 01:23:27,533
I found a cute B&B
where we can spend the night.

735
01:23:28,775 --> 01:23:31,847
The kids are so looking forward to the trip.

736
01:23:32,056 --> 01:23:34,809
They talk about the Pyrenees...

737
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:37,809
...like they were Disneyland.

738
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:44,373
My darling one, what you see on
there are not stars.

739
01:23:45,018 --> 01:23:47,930
It's your nervous system.

740
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:53,457
You could at least show you care.

741
01:24:55,585 --> 01:24:58,895
We're ruined.

742
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,298
Finished.

743
01:25:03,787 --> 01:25:06,221
We could have...

744
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:09,101
Shut up. It was your idea.

745
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:11,583
What's happened? Where are they?

746
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:15,227
- Where are they?
- You fucking piece of shit!

747
01:25:15,428 --> 01:25:18,181
- You fucking murderer!
- Shut up!

748
01:25:18,349 --> 01:25:21,659
- It was your idea too.
- We gotta scram.

749
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:25,060
- I don't wanna end up in jail.
- No one ever does.

750
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,425
Where are they?

751
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,665
Down there in the cellar.

752
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,903
We gotta decide what to do
with the one that's alive.

753
01:25:37,111 --> 01:25:39,227
There's one that's alive?

754
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:42,701
There were two, but we couldn't...
One of them died.

755
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,101
Could be seen as suicide.

756
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:47,422
Promise me no one will know anything.

757
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:51,582
I'll give you all the money you need.
Just say how much.

758
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,476
Help me, help me!.

759
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:04,240
What are you doing?

760
01:27:04,441 --> 01:27:05,351
Help me!

761
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:08,758
Uxbal, leave her alone. She's already dead.

762
01:29:09,137 --> 01:29:10,695
What'll we do?

763
01:29:11,657 --> 01:29:13,454
You gotta help me.

764
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:17,494
I don't know.
Lock the goddamned warehouse.

765
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:34,295
Hang on, Marambra.
Dear Marambra, listen to me.

766
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:36,695
Listen to me.

767
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,368
Take the train this evening,
and we'll see in the morning.

768
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,213
Don't change the plan.
Don't change a fucking thing.

769
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,452
Take the kids and go to the Pyrenees

770
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:51,299
Tell Ana I'm sorry, but we'll have
her birthday party when she comes home.

771
01:30:23,345 --> 01:30:27,543
I tried to pray, but I don't know
who I should pray to.

772
01:30:27,746 --> 01:30:31,136
Haven't you slept at all? Out with it.

773
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:38,344
I bought the damned stoves
because they were cheapest.

774
01:30:39,947 --> 01:30:42,905
Because I needed the goddamned money.

775
01:30:44,748 --> 01:30:47,740
I knew the stoves were rejects.

776
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:52,987
It's my fault, Bea. All my fault...

777
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:07,949
They're all dead.

778
01:31:11,831 --> 01:31:15,062
25 people, Bea. There were women there.

779
01:31:17,192 --> 01:31:20,309
And children... Lili was there.

780
01:31:20,472 --> 01:31:24,784
I wanted to ask her to forgive me,
but she was already dead.

781
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:31,623
I don't know if I'm going to the police.
I'm really frightened...

782
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:34,626
It was an accident, Uxbal.

783
01:31:35,314 --> 01:31:37,384
It's OK.

784
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:42,313
You know what you must do, Uxbal.

785
01:31:44,274 --> 01:31:46,834
Go and find them...

786
01:31:46,995 --> 01:31:48,474
...and beg their forgiveness.

787
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:50,792
No, not that...

788
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,911
Not that...

789
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:03,252
Tito...

790
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:05,329
Where's the prodigal son.

791
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,730
What's up with you?
I've been trying to get hold of you.

792
01:35:07,899 --> 01:35:11,574
I left a thousand messages.

793
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:16,536
Why don't you answer when I call?
Come here.

794
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:18,971
This is my out-of-reach brother.

795
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,812
What will you have to drink?

796
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,620
- Dunno. - Clara!

797
01:35:23,821 --> 01:35:26,733
Mendoza went ballistic.
He nearly cut my balls off.

798
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,938
Clara, give me one...two Jack Daniel's.

799
01:35:30,343 --> 01:35:33,699
None of the Chinese came to work.
These sort of delays cost a fortune.

800
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:36,536
- What happened?
- There was a problem, Tito.

801
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:39,695
What the hell?
Why didn't you come to me?

802
01:35:40,504 --> 01:35:42,381
Because... I don't know.

803
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,813
Come here, Cclarita.

804
01:35:45,424 --> 01:35:48,302
Drink, we'll discuss this in the morning.

805
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:51,980
Hang on... I've got to talk to you, Tito.

806
01:35:52,145 --> 01:35:54,943
Here you gotta scream or
be on top of one another.

807
01:35:55,105 --> 01:35:57,061
Look at her there.

808
01:36:03,506 --> 01:36:05,576
Wow, you've got a thirst.

809
01:36:05,747 --> 01:36:07,942
Look behind me. The bird in pink.

810
01:36:08,107 --> 01:36:11,065
I've fucked her up the arse.
She loves to fuck.

811
01:36:12,388 --> 01:36:14,344
She's only a little girl.

812
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:16,259
Cheers!

813
01:36:20,549 --> 01:36:22,301
I've got nothing.

814
01:36:30,189 --> 01:36:32,020
Here it is.

815
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:36,583
Is Chepas here?

816
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:42,066
What's up with you? Look at him.

817
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:45,103
How long is it since you were out?

818
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:48,262
It was at least 2 years ago.
Look at him now.

819
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:51,185
He looks like the fucking Dalai Lama.

820
01:37:01,033 --> 01:37:03,228
Here. Hai darling.

821
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,945
No, don't give him anything.

822
01:37:12,155 --> 01:37:14,305
Let him suffer.

823
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:22,704
Now we can talk. Do you want a drink?

824
01:37:24,076 --> 01:37:27,034
Get Ccepa's stuff. I'm going to the loo.

825
01:37:27,196 --> 01:37:30,506
- Are you hungry for adventure, girls?
- How come? We know you're gay.

826
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:42,518
Your brother's an idiot.
Do you know that?

827
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,633
Yeah, he sure is.

828
01:37:47,839 --> 01:37:50,307
And how many kids do you have?

829
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:54,678
- How many kids do you have?
- Two.

830
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,559
- Where are they now?
- They've gone away.

831
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,073
They've gone up to the snow.

832
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,874
- Who with?
- With their mum.

833
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,589
- Why didn't you go with them?
- 'cause I can't.

834
01:38:08,321 --> 01:38:10,277
Why can't you?

835
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:12,591
Why can't you?

836
01:38:13,001 --> 01:38:15,674
Because I'm dying.

837
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:23,995
I'm dying of cancer.

838
01:41:18,945 --> 01:41:20,856
Mateo, my sweet?

839
01:41:29,705 --> 01:41:31,024
Mateo.

840
01:41:32,265 --> 01:41:33,857
kiddo...

841
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:37,579
Why are you all alone?

842
01:41:39,347 --> 01:41:41,577
I wet myself.

843
01:41:41,747 --> 01:41:44,136
Don't worry about that.

844
01:41:44,867 --> 01:41:47,017
What happened?

845
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:49,419
Mamma punished me.

846
01:41:51,667 --> 01:41:54,898
She left me here.
She went off with Ana.

847
01:41:55,668 --> 01:41:57,977
They went up to the snow.

848
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,588
What have you done to your face?

849
01:42:04,749 --> 01:42:07,468
I was very disobedient.

850
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:23,980
Daddy...

851
01:42:32,392 --> 01:42:33,711
Daddy...

852
01:42:43,594 --> 01:42:45,824
Let me explain.

853
01:42:45,995 --> 01:42:49,670
- It was Ana's birthday and Mateo...
- Don't talk to me, Marambra.

854
01:43:08,237 --> 01:43:10,228
It's good you're moving.

855
01:43:12,918 --> 01:43:16,433
I'm really glad you're pissing off.
You hear that?

856
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:20,229
Goddamned pig.

857
01:43:20,759 --> 01:43:25,230
You're a goddamned pig!
You can't even look at me, eh?

858
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,555
Give me the photo, Marambra.

859
01:43:46,081 --> 01:43:47,799
Let's go, Mateo.

860
01:43:48,602 --> 01:43:50,752
Children will stay here.

861
01:43:50,963 --> 01:43:53,238
I am looking for the goods later.

862
01:43:53,402 --> 01:43:56,951
You do not take the boy.

863
01:43:58,003 --> 01:43:59,641
Come on, sweetie.

864
01:43:59,804 --> 01:44:02,921
Leave him alone.

865
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:06,712
Stop, you're all messed up.

866
01:44:06,884 --> 01:44:10,877
Source already, for heaven's sake.

867
01:44:11,045 --> 01:44:14,515
Reach.
Let go of Mateosta.

868
01:44:14,685 --> 01:44:16,915
Let go, Marambra.

869
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:19,241
I can not.

870
01:44:20,645 --> 01:44:22,476
Let me go!

871
01:44:23,646 --> 01:44:27,798
To get Mateo.

872
01:44:29,326 --> 01:44:33,035
Let it go.

873
01:44:37,288 --> 01:44:39,040
Ana ... Ana!

874
01:44:46,369 --> 01:44:48,758
Take the ring.

875
01:45:17,573 --> 01:45:20,167
Take the children's room.

876
01:45:21,973 --> 01:45:24,362
We will be changing my room.

877
01:45:27,893 --> 01:45:29,929
Vanhako is it?

878
01:45:30,095 --> 01:45:31,892
14 months.

879
01:45:32,054 --> 01:45:35,842
Four days later.

880
01:45:36,055 --> 01:45:37,454
Samuel.

881
01:45:37,655 --> 01:45:40,328
- Eto'on that?
- Yes.

882
01:45:40,495 --> 01:45:44,613
- Ekweme was a fan of Barcelona.
- Who?

883
01:45:46,736 --> 01:45:48,613
His dad.

884
01:46:00,057 --> 01:46:03,652
Tell him to be quiet. Quieten him.

885
01:46:03,818 --> 01:46:06,013
Sleep now, Mateo.

886
01:46:08,818 --> 01:46:12,891
Daddy, Why is Ige living at our place?

887
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,691
'Cause he doesn't have any home of his own.
And he has a little kid.

888
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:22,489
- Can I answer?
- No, as I've already told you.

889
01:47:50,031 --> 01:47:52,261
Where are the kids?

890
01:47:52,431 --> 01:47:54,547
I followed them to school.

891
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:58,380
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- You slept like a log.

892
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:03,268
Ana said she knew the way
and Mateo thought it was OK.

893
01:48:05,033 --> 01:48:06,625
What time is it?

894
01:48:06,793 --> 01:48:09,626
I don't know, it must be one.

895
01:48:17,634 --> 01:48:20,865
If you like, I can pick up the kids.

896
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,355
He went ballistic.

897
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:09,519
Liwei betrayed me.
Everything was his idea.

898
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:13,190
You know what sort of a guy he was.

899
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,677
He threw them in, 300 metres out to sea.

900
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:22,800
Shimuya swore that the bodies
sank to the bottom.

901
01:49:23,522 --> 01:49:28,038
Liwei thought you'd betray us.
I was afraid too.

902
01:49:28,202 --> 01:49:31,114
They've taken my family.
My daughter Suyin.

903
01:49:31,323 --> 01:49:33,962
To top it all off, Liwei came
looking for me and cried.

904
01:49:34,124 --> 01:49:37,355
This is insane.
What do you want me to do?

905
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:40,084
What do you want me to do?

906
01:49:41,245 --> 01:49:45,955
We can't stand here.
Get away from here and be quick about it.

907
01:49:46,284 --> 01:49:48,559
- What do you want?
- You aren't innocent, Uxbal.

908
01:49:48,725 --> 01:49:51,956
- What?
- Don't play dumb.

909
01:49:57,446 --> 01:49:59,596
You gotta get it into your head.

910
01:50:01,687 --> 01:50:05,441
My people don't squeal. I promise you.

911
01:50:05,607 --> 01:50:08,804
You gotta shut up anyone you know
who knows anything.

912
01:50:32,811 --> 01:50:36,406
<i>The news has shocked the whole country.</i>

913
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:40,120
<i>The latest we know is that most of
the dead are men-</i>

914
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:44,807
<i>-but among them were also found
two women and three children.</i>

915
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:48,521
<i>We warn that these images may disturb
some viewers. The search for bodies continues...</i>

916
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:50,848
No, I don't know.

917
01:50:51,013 --> 01:50:53,652
It's not certain. No, it's not certain.

918
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:56,008
What? No.

919
01:50:57,013 --> 01:51:00,449
Near the Chinese's warehouse.
I don't know.

920
01:51:01,093 --> 01:51:04,768
One family or something. Just a sec,
there's someone at the door.

921
01:51:04,934 --> 01:51:08,165
No, no, no, don't hang up.

922
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,729
What the hell are you doing here?

923
01:51:12,455 --> 01:51:15,527
- I heard it right.
- Why didn't you say anything to me?

924
01:51:17,816 --> 01:51:20,694
Are we talking about the same thing?
This is terrible.

925
01:51:22,616 --> 01:51:25,130
Want a drink?

926
01:51:25,657 --> 01:51:27,329
- Marambras purse?
- Leave it alone.

927
01:51:27,497 --> 01:51:30,933
I don't understand. Did you murder them, Uxbal?

928
01:51:31,098 --> 01:51:32,929
- Fucking piece of shit.
- For chrissakes, Uxbal...

929
01:51:33,097 --> 01:51:34,894
Fucking piece of shit.

930
01:51:38,338 --> 01:51:41,887
<i>He was totally hysterical
and stood and cried. </i>

931
01:51:42,098 --> 01:51:45,647
What was I supposed to do?
Leave her out there?

932
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:47,975
This is partly your fault, Uxbal.

933
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:53,493
If I see you anywhere near
my wife or my children...

934
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:57,175
...under a kilometre away,
I swear on my mother...

935
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:01,009
... I'll kill you,
you fucking piece of shit.

936
01:52:26,584 --> 01:52:28,779
I can't move.

937
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,662
I feel like if I touched my neck...

938
01:52:33,825 --> 01:52:36,055
...my head would fall off.

939
01:52:36,225 --> 01:52:39,297
Calm down. Nothing's gonna fall off.

940
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,980
If I close my eyes...

941
01:52:44,146 --> 01:52:46,979
....the tanks are coming.

942
01:52:47,827 --> 01:52:50,341
They scare  me.

943
01:52:51,586 --> 01:52:55,056
I called you. I rang you over and over.

944
01:52:56,548 --> 01:53:00,143
I don't have what the children need.

945
01:53:01,749 --> 01:53:05,185
I'm sorry I was nasty to Mateo.

946
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:11,221
I do what I can to survive.

947
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:15,790
I want to be faithful to you.

948
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:19,548
But i also want to have a bit of fun ...

949
01:53:19,951 --> 01:53:21,748
...as a whore.

950
01:53:21,911 --> 01:53:24,379
Don't say that, Marambra.

951
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:29,107
I'm sorry.

952
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:32,146
I never knew what I should give you.

953
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:35,110
I still don't know.

954
01:53:35,312 --> 01:53:38,622
Come to think of it...
I've never known it

955
01:53:40,233 --> 01:53:43,111
But we've hurt each other so much.

956
01:53:43,634 --> 01:53:46,148
Take me on a holiday again.

957
01:53:47,273 --> 01:53:49,912
At the clinic they have to tie me...

958
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:51,791
Quiet.

959
01:53:52,235 --> 01:53:56,626
Quiet. It'll be OK It's going to be OK.

960
01:57:05,218 --> 01:57:09,052
She is in the same house where
we visited her before.

961
01:57:09,218 --> 01:57:10,970
Remember?

962
01:57:11,138 --> 01:57:13,094
And she...

963
01:57:13,419 --> 01:57:16,650
We must just let her rest.

964
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:19,579
-Take her hand? -Yes.

965
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:24,336
She has 20 people who take her hand.

966
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:30,374
She sent lots of kisses.
She loves you lots and lots.

967
01:57:34,061 --> 01:57:37,258
- Can we say hello to her?
- Yes, of course darling.

968
01:57:37,421 --> 01:57:40,299
But now we have to let her rest.

969
01:58:00,465 --> 01:58:02,137
Make a wish, little lady.

970
01:58:13,065 --> 01:58:15,704
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

971
01:58:15,866 --> 01:58:18,824
- Don't shove it up your nose.
- Give me your hand.

972
01:58:20,866 --> 01:58:23,061
What's that? A booger?

973
01:58:26,988 --> 01:58:31,140
It's something you shall have
from your daddy.

974
01:58:33,147 --> 01:58:35,786
Are you scared of it?

975
01:58:36,428 --> 01:58:38,419
Do you promise?

976
01:58:40,589 --> 01:58:42,386
- Are you frightened of it?
- Yes.

977
01:58:45,149 --> 01:58:48,585
Shouldn't we have the cake now?
Sit down , Ige.

978
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:53,224
The first thing we must do...

979
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:55,785
Mateo, don't be disgusting.
...is to eat yummy chocolate cake.

980
01:59:08,912 --> 01:59:11,551
The kids are so fond of you Ige.

981
01:59:12,032 --> 01:59:14,307
You and Samuel.

982
01:59:16,433 --> 01:59:20,108
You have a home here. And you can
stay as long as you want.

983
01:59:20,753 --> 01:59:25,269
No, Uxbal. I'm also fond of the children...

984
01:59:25,435 --> 01:59:29,792
... but I'll save up some money
and then I'm going back.

985
01:59:29,955 --> 01:59:32,344
This is no place for us.

986
01:59:32,515 --> 01:59:34,824
Ekweme told me about...

987
01:59:37,555 --> 01:59:39,511
Wait.

988
01:59:51,598 --> 01:59:55,386
Here is enough for rent for a whole year...

989
01:59:55,557 --> 01:59:57,627
...and much more.

990
01:59:57,798 --> 02:00:01,074
All for the children. Do you understand?

991
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:05,957
Take the money.

992
02:00:07,639 --> 02:00:09,436
Take them.

993
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,479
Ige, please...

994
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,115
Can't you stay?

995
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:20,748
I need your help.

996
02:00:21,721 --> 02:00:24,758
Take it now. Take it.

997
02:00:53,404 --> 02:00:55,042
Goddamn... What is it?

998
02:00:55,245 --> 02:00:57,122
Nothing.

999
02:00:57,605 --> 02:01:01,598
- Why aren't you in school?
- Don't lie to me Daddy.

1000
02:01:11,727 --> 02:01:12,842
Come here.

1001
02:01:26,008 --> 02:01:28,283
Does your brother know anything about this?

1002
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:36,000
You can't leave us.

1003
02:01:38,891 --> 02:01:41,485
I won't.

1004
02:01:47,532 --> 02:01:49,329
Look in my eyes.

1005
02:01:51,612 --> 02:01:53,762
Look at my face.

1006
02:01:55,332 --> 02:01:58,130
Promise to remember me.

1007
02:01:58,372 --> 02:02:00,488
Don't forget me, Ana.

1008
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:04,370
Don't forget me, my darling.

1009
02:04:56,793 --> 02:04:57,987
Ige?

1010
02:05:01,554 --> 02:05:02,623
Ige?

1011
02:05:04,594 --> 02:05:08,382
yes, it's me. I'm back.

1012
02:07:18,251 --> 02:07:20,162
Daddy, are you OK?

1013
02:07:27,411 --> 02:07:29,083
Yes, darling.

1014
02:07:29,812 --> 02:07:31,404
Does it hurt?

1015
02:07:31,653 --> 02:07:33,166
No.

1016
02:07:33,852 --> 02:07:37,401
I can't sleep. Light...

1017
02:07:59,976 --> 02:08:03,173
The ring looks funny on your hand.

1018
02:08:05,216 --> 02:08:07,491
Can I look at it?

1019
02:08:12,618 --> 02:08:15,291
- Is it real?
- Yes.

1020
02:08:18,338 --> 02:08:21,887
It was from my daddy to my mummy.

1021
02:08:22,179 --> 02:08:24,409
And why have you got it?

1022
02:08:26,819 --> 02:08:28,616
To...

1023
02:08:29,419 --> 02:08:32,013
...your grandfather gave it
to your grandmother...

1024
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:35,172
...before he left Spain.

1025
02:08:36,141 --> 02:08:38,735
She was pregnant and expecting him...

1026
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:41,850
...and she never saw him again.

1027
02:08:42,021 --> 02:08:46,856
It's lovely. I never thought
I'd touch a real diamond.

1028
02:08:48,182 --> 02:08:51,015
- Can I try it on?
- Yes.

1029
02:09:01,103 --> 02:09:04,459
- It's yours now darling.
- Really?

1030
02:09:05,224 --> 02:09:08,660
Mummy always wore it on this finger.

1031
02:09:09,305 --> 02:09:12,297
She said it wasn't real.

1032
02:09:17,065 --> 02:09:19,579
Your mother never heard the sound.

1033
02:09:19,745 --> 02:09:21,337
What sound?

1034
02:09:21,505 --> 02:09:23,496
The sound of the sea.

1035
02:09:25,386 --> 02:09:28,025
<i>When in a small..</i>

1036
02:09:28,186 --> 02:09:32,099
<i>one radio station played
the sounds of the sea.</i>

1037
02:09:33,107 --> 02:09:35,496
<i>Giant waves.</i>

1038
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:49,624
<i>The sounds scared me.</i>

1039
02:09:50,869 --> 02:09:53,337
<i>Why is it scared you?</i>

1040
02:09:54,710 --> 02:09:57,622
<i>The bottom of the sea scared me.</i>

1041
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:01,703
<i>Did you know that when an owl dies,
it spits out a fur ball?</i>

1042
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:04,783
<i>All the creatures that live there.</i>

1043
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:08,744
<i>You shouldn't go with the ponytail.
It makes you look like a fox.</i>

1044
02:10:09,031 --> 02:10:11,499
<i>It scares away the owls.</i>

1045
02:10:13,152 --> 02:10:14,471
Daddy?

1046
02:10:20,633 --> 02:10:21,986
Dad?

1047
02:10:25,593 --> 02:10:27,743
Do not you think?

1048
02:10:28,754 --> 02:10:30,585
Dad?

1049
02:10:45,876 --> 02:10:48,185
Here it was just before the water.

1050
02:10:49,036 --> 02:10:52,028
Salt water.

1051
02:10:53,317 --> 02:10:55,785
Guess what it sounded like?

1052
02:11:02,398 --> 02:11:04,354
And the wind?

1053
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:13,909
And they work together?

1054
02:11:58,645 --> 02:12:00,920
What is it?

1055
02:12:26,015 --> 02:12:31,965
